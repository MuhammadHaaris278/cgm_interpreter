  "interpretation_text": "The patient\u2019s CGM data demonstrates suboptimal glycemic control, with a mean glucose of 158 mg/dL (GMI 7.09%) and significant glycemic variability (CV 49.7%, SD 78.6 mg/dL). Time in range (44.9%) is below target, with excessive time spent both below range (16.5%) and above range (38.6%). Notably, there were 21 hypoglycemia events, all occurring nocturnally, and 49 hyperglycemia events; only 2 postprandial spikes were detected. No dawn phenomenon was observed.\r\n\r\nAbnormal patterns include frequent and exclusively nocturnal hypoglycemia, elevated glycemic variability, and insufficient time in range. Postprandial excursions are minimal, suggesting basal insulin or overnight dosing may be the primary contributors to dysglycemia.\r\n\r\nClinical guidance: Intensify glucose management to increase time in range and reduce both hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes. Reassess and likely reduce overnight basal insulin to mitigate nocturnal hypoglycemia. Evaluate the patient\u2019s hypoglycemia awareness and carbohydrate intake, particularly before bedtime. Address elevated glycemic variability by reviewing basal-bolus dosing strategies and meal timing. Consider diabetes education reinforcement and close follow-up. The patient should be gone to icu"
