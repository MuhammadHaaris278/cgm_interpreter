  "interpretation_text": "The patient demonstrates excellent overall glycemic control, with a mean glucose of 114 mg/dL, GMI of 6.04%, and 96.5% time in range (70\u2013180 mg/dL). Glycemic variability is low (CV 18.7%), and there are no episodes of hyperglycemia or postprandial spikes. However, 3.5% of time is spent below range (<70 mg/dL), with 10 hypoglycemia events, including 5 nocturnal episodes.\n\nAbnormal patterns identified include recurrent hypoglycemia, particularly nocturnal hypoglycemia. No evidence of dawn phenomenon or postprandial hyperglycemia is present.\n\nRecommend evaluating overnight basal insulin dosing to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. Assess patient\u2019s hypoglycemia awareness and review carbohydrate intake, especially before bedtime. Consider patient education on hypoglycemia prevention and adjust therapy as indicated to minimize risk of future events."
