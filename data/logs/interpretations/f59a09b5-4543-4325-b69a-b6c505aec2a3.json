  "interpretation_text": "The patient demonstrates excellent overall glycemic control, with a mean glucose of 114 mg/dL, GMI of 6.04%, and 96.5% time in range (70\u2013180 mg/dL). Glycemic variability is low (CV 18.7%), and there are no episodes of hyperglycemia or postprandial spikes. However, 3.5% of readings are below range, with two hypoglycemia events, including one nocturnal episode.\n\nAbnormal patterns identified include mild hypoglycemia, particularly overnight, without evidence of dawn phenomenon or hyperglycemia.\n\nRecommend evaluating overnight basal insulin dosing to reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia risk. Review patient\u2019s hypoglycemia awareness and carbohydrate intake, and reinforce strategies for hypoglycemia prevention and management. No adjustments needed for hyperglycemia at this time."
