  "interpretation_text": "The patient\u2019s CGM data demonstrates suboptimal glycemic control with a mean glucose of 158 mg/dL (GMI 7.09%), elevated glycemic variability (CV 49.7%), and only 44.9% time in range. Notably, there is significant hypoglycemia (16.5% time <70 mg/dL, 21 hypoglycemic events\u2014all nocturnal), as well as frequent hyperglycemia (38.6% time >180 mg/dL, 49 events) and postprandial spikes (8 events). The dawn phenomenon is present, indicating early morning hyperglycemia.\n\nAbnormal patterns include frequent and exclusively nocturnal hypoglycemia, pronounced glycemic variability, recurrent postprandial hyperglycemic excursions, and evidence of the dawn phenomenon.\n\nRecommendations: Intensify glucose control to increase time in range and reduce both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Reassess overnight basal insulin dosing to address nocturnal hypoglycemia and dawn phenomenon; consider adjusting basal rate or split dosing. Review patient\u2019s hypoglycemia awareness and carbohydrate intake, and address potential bolus timing or carbohydrate misestimation contributing to postprandial spikes. Aim to reduce glycemic variability through optimization of basal-bolus regimen and meal planning."
