  "interpretation_text": "The patient\u2019s CGM data indicate suboptimal glycemic control, with a mean glucose of 158 mg/dL (GMI 7.09%) and only 44.9% time in range. Glycemic variability is markedly elevated (CV 49.7%, SD 78.6 mg/dL). There is significant hypoglycemia, with 16.5% time below 70 mg/dL and 21 hypoglycemic events, all occurring nocturnally. Hyperglycemia is also present (38.6% time >180 mg/dL, 49 events), though postprandial spikes are infrequent.\n\nAbnormal patterns include frequent and exclusively nocturnal hypoglycemia, high glycemic variability, and persistent hyperglycemia. No dawn phenomenon is detected.\n\nRecommendations: Intensify glucose management to increase time in range and reduce both hypo- and hyperglycemic excursions. Reassess overnight basal insulin dosing to address nocturnal hypoglycemia. Evaluate the patient\u2019s hypoglycemia awareness and review carbohydrate intake. Consider strategies to reduce glycemic variability, such as adjusting basal-bolus regimens or meal timing."
