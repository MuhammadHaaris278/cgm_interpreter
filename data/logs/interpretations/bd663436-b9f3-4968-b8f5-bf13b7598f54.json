Glycemic variability is low (CV 18.7%), and there are no episodes of hyperglycemia or postprandial spikes. However, 3.5% time is spent below range, with 10 hypoglycemia events, including 5 nocturnal episodes.\n\nAbnormal patterns identified include recurrent hypoglycemia, particularly overnight, despite absence of hyperglycemia or dawn phenomenon.\n\nRecommend evaluating and potentially reducing overnight basal insulin to minimize nocturnal hypoglycemia. Assess patient\u2019s hypoglycemia awareness and review carbohydrate intake, especially at bedtime. Reinforce hypoglycemia prevention strategies and consider further CGM review if episodes persist."
